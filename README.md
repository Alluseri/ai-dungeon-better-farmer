# Better ad farmer for AI Dungeon
A new, better & safer advertisement farmer & bypass for AI Dungeon.

**If you came here from v1, please watch the new showcase instead!**

## Precautions
Don't be too greedy. It's highly unlikely the project will get outdated and abandoned in a matter of days, so, if you want to farm, don't do it aggressively. +300 actions per day at most. More will get you flagged, so don't hold me responsible for this.

## Is it working right now?
Yes, 22.10.2022

## Usage
Check out the [showcase](https://check.the.url/you-are-too-early-and-i-am-too-lazy) for an all-in-1 in-depth guide.
1. Install TamperMonkey(GreaseMonkey NOT TESTED!).
2. Copy the contents of either provided `.js` file(`ai-dungeon-better-farmer.min.js` recommended) into clipboard.
3. Create a new TamperMonkey script and paste the copied contents into the script content(overwrite everything!).
4. Ctrl+S.
5. Enable it if required.
6. Open any adventure play of yours and, if you don't see the additional buttons on your hotbar, refresh the page.
7. Click `+10 ACTIONS` or `+10 ACTIONS [FAST]`(fast mode might get the counter out of sync).
8. Your updated actions will be visible at the top right.
9. To use the newly acquired actions, you'll have to refresh the page again.
