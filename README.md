3. Create a new TamperMonkey script and paste the copied contents into the script content(overwrite everything!).
4. Ctrl+S.
5. Enable it if required.
6. Open any adventure play of yours(or refresh the page), you'll see 2 additional buttons on your hotbar.

### How do I change the settings?
1. Download & open either provided file in any text editor of your preference. Notepad works just fine.
2. Place "yes" after the first setting, which immediately makes you responsible for a potential ban and enables unsafe mode.
3. Change the settings you're looking to change.
4. Save the file.
Supported values: `true`/`yes`/`enable`/`enabled` & `false`/`no`/`disable`/`disabled`(interchangeable)
