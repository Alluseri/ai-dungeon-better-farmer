# Better ad farmer for AI Dungeon
A new, better & safer advertisement farmer & bypass for AI Dungeon.

## Important
AIDBF v2.4x is the last version of AIDBF. Development stopped because it's already perfect and who cares anyway?

[AI Dungeon Farmer](https://github.com/Alluseri/ai-dungeon-farmer) still works, so if AIDBF breaks, use that instead. You remember how, right?

I'll keep increasing the farmed actions by 1000 every 24 hours this doesn't get banned and update the link: https://www.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/ygjppv/can_we_get_this_acc_banned_in_under_24_hours/
(Spoiler: I will forget by tomorrow)

## Is it working right now?
Works 29.10.2022.

## Usage
Check out the [guide](https://youtu.be/vEd1EaMEhl0) for **Android users** if you are one.

For browser users:
1. Install TamperMonkey(GreaseMonkey NOT TESTED!).
2. Copy the contents of either provided `.js` file(`ai-dungeon-better-farmer.min.js` recommended) into clipboard.
3. Create a new TamperMonkey script and paste the copied contents into the script content(overwrite everything!).
4. Ctrl+S.
5. Enable it if required.
6. Open any adventure play of yours and, if you don't see the additional buttons on your hotbar, refresh the page.
7. Click `+10 ACTIONS` or `+10 ACTIONS [FAST]`(fast mode might get the counter out of sync).
8. Your updated actions will be visible at the top right.
9. To use the newly acquired actions, you'll have to refresh the page again.
10. Enjoy!
